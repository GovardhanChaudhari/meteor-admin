problem : 
	Do I need to hard code the CRUD operation for the Model definitions or I can use the existing
generic logic to perform the CRUD.

Sol:

	- in generic CURD check the model name, if it is 'model' then use ModelDb else subscribe
		the model.
		
	- publish the model def where it is created. ie in model_db.js

problem: during creation of model definitions.
